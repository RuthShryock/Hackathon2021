# LUNARPLANS

The idea behind LunarPlans was to have a web app that will give each user their own calendar. This calendar would give informaiton about the moon, stars, meteors, and most importantly environmental regarding space in order to help raise awareness. 

# Important Features

  - The ability to register and login to the web app.
  - The ability to add events to the calendar.
  - Space themed reminders sent to the users email (These are space events happening on the day).
  - Have two viewing options... Calendar view and List view.

# Expectations

Given that our team is full of beginners, we aimed to setup a server using Google Cloud and creating a UI for both the registration and login pages. We were able to create the server as a LAMP stack server and we created the registration/login pages, but we also ran into a few issues. One issue being that our Google Cloud server was not allowing us to edit and upload files into the server.
